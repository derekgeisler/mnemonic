Dynamic Mnemonic Wordlists

Hereâ€™s a basic structure for a novel mnemonic generation and derivation path system in Python. This is purely illustrative and would require further development and testing for practical use.

Explanation

Custom Wordlists: The generate_mnemonic function allows for a custom wordlist, which could be unique to each user or group.

Multiple Seeds: The system could be expanded to support multiple seeds, combined in various ways to derive keys.

Time-Based Derivation: The time_based_derivation function introduces a novel method where the derived key depends on the current time, adding an extra layer of security.

Layered Security: The derive_key function includes an optional secondary factor (e.g., password, biometric data) that further secures the derived keys.

Next Steps

To develop this into a full-fledged system:

Security Audit: Ensure that the new system is thoroughly tested and audited for security.

Documentation: Create comprehensive documentation and user guides.

Integration: Integrate the new derivation path into wallet software or other blockchain tools.
